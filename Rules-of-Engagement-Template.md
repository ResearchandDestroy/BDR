## Rules of Engagement during Breach data research on behalf of _______________. 

#### This document has been prepared by ____________________ to outline the ethical guidelines and process to be taken to ensure the safety of our researchers while conducting online investigations for gathering breach data through Open-Source Intelligence techniques. 
#### This project is volunteer-based and will be documented by means of a roster outside of this document and maintained by ____________________ while shared with __________________ Legal team. 

## Research Process

#### All researchers will submit their legal name and code-name associated with the research to the official legal roster for legal tracking purposes. 
#### Research will be performed in accordance with the allocated project hours associated with this project as maintained through RDM and project scheduling. 
#### Researchers will be tasked to design an ephemeral workstation following strict Operational Security guidelines. 
#### All breach data research will be conducted from within their personal workstation, not tied to _______________-owned resources. 
#### The datasets discovered will be temporarily housed on the encrypted storage within _____________ researcher’s personal workstation. 
#### The raw datasets will be offloaded to a ____________-owned hardened and ephemeral infrastructure as designed by _________________ where the researcher will curate the dataset as necessary to match the “combolist” format of only “email address:password”, removing all data entries which use the Top-Level-Domains [TLD] associated with US Government entities, ‘.gov’ and ‘.mil’. 
#### The researcher will then migrate the curated datasets to the internal ________________ host behind the ______________ virtual private network. 
#### Upon completion of research tasks, the recovered datasets will be securely wiped using the DoD 5220.22-M ECE standard, an extended (7-pass) version of the DoD 5220.22-M, within the researcher’s personal workstation as well as within ______________-owned ephemeral infrastructure. 

## Breach Data Retention Policy

#### The Data Retention policy for the breach data collected will be retained ______________ (E.g. biennially) for curated combolists and up to _____ (E.g. ten) year(s) for password lists as derived from the datasets acquired. 
#### The policy will follow the original dates in which the data was obtained, curated, and derived and will be subsequently destroyed upon reach of the ____________ (E.g. biennial) anniversary in accordance with the DoD 5220.22-M ECE standard.

## Ethical Practice Adherence Policy

### The Ethical Practice Adherence policy for breach data researchers at _____________, as enabled through _________________ is expressed as follows:
#### •	Researchers will NOT under any circumstance, pay for any breach data from any third-party or directly from criminals associated with online hacking forums, as to avoid funding Cyber-terrorism and Cyberwarfare.
#### •	Researchers will NOT under any circumstance, converse, divulge information, or reveal their identities to any third party or criminals associated with the online hacking forums.
#### •	Researchers will NOT under any circumstance, retain any breach data discovered during operations for personal use or monetary gain.
#### •	Researchers will NOT under any circumstance, retain any personally identifiable information (PII) discovered during operations to be housed within ____________-owned resources.
#### •	Researchers will NOT under any circumstance, store breach datasets on personal workstations longer than the given operation timeline.
#### •	Researchers will NOT under any circumstance, procure client-engagement data with the breach data collected during research operations.

#### The researchers and facilitators within _______________ solemnly swear to uphold the Rules of Engagement as described in this document. 
#### The following signatures dictate this clearance to perform this research.

#### ____________ Legal: _________________________________________________, Date: __________,
